# Problem Statement 

* To build a machine learning model that accurately classifies Iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica based on their sepal and petal measurements using a Decision Tree classifier.

# Objective

* To classify Iris flowers using a Decision Tree model.
* To analyze prediction performance using accuracy and classification report.
* To visualize the decision-making process through a tree diagram.

# Dataset Description

* Dataset: Iris Dataset (scikit-learn)
* Total Samples: 150
# Features:
* Sepal Length
* Sepal Width
* Petal Length
* Petal Width
* Classes: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica
* No missing values

# Features Used

* All 4 numerical features from the Iris dataset

# Algorithm Used

* Decision Tree Classifier
* Splits data using Gini impurity
* Easy to interpret and visualize
* Good for small classification problems

 # Results

* High model accuracy
* Classification report for each class
* Decision Tree visualization showing how the model splits data

# Visualization Explanation

* The tree shows how feature values guide the decision process.
* Each node represents a condition based on a feature.
* Colors indicate predicted classes.
* Leaf nodes show the final classification.

# Conclusion

* Decision Tree accurately predicted the Iris flower species.
* Visualization makes the model transparent and easy to understand.
* Feature importance reveals which measurements influence decisions most.
